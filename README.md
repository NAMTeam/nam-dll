# nam-dll

A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that improves interoperability with the Network Addon Mod.

## System Requirements

* Windows 10 or later

The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed, but I do not have the ability to test that.

## Installation

1. Close SimCity 4.
2. Copy `NAM.dll` into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
3. Start SimCity 4.

## Troubleshooting

The plugin should write a `NAM.log` file in the same folder as the plugin.    
The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.

# Source Code

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2022

## Building the plugin

* Open the solution in the `src` folder
* Update the post build events to copy the build output to you SimCity 4 application plugins folder.
* Build the solution

## Debugging the plugin

Visual Studio can be configured to launch SimCity 4 on the Debugging page of the project properties.
I configured the debugger to launch the game in a window with the following command line:    
`-intro:off -CPUcount:1 -w -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32`

You may need to adjust the resolution for your screen.

## Building the DLL on Linux

It is possible to compile the DLL on Linux using `clang` as a cross-compiler.
Check the [Makefile](Makefile) for details.
